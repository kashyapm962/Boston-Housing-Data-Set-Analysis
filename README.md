# Boston-Housing-Data-Set-Analysis
In this data set we are analysing the Boston Housing data set to predict future prices.
### Part 1
#### Data Collection
The data set that we are using for our analysis is the standard dataset which is present in the sci-kit learn library.
### Part 2
#### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this part after loading the data we do some EDA on the dataset and try to find more about our data set.We check all the statistical parameters of the input variable like correlation with the output variable.
### Part 3
#### Applying Linear Regression to the Data Set
Now we move further to apply linear regression to the data with the scipy library which has a nice interface to apply linear model using OLS(Ordinary Least Square) method.

## Conclusion
On the basis of our analysis we can conclude that the data fits the linear model accurately and we can use our model to predict the housing prices in future.
